This is my solution to HW2.

## Problem 2

Tidy data into “minute of the day” and “activity count” columns

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_or_weekend =
      recode(day,
             "Monday" = "weekday",
             "Tuesday" = "weekday",
             "Wednesday" = "weekday",
             "Thursday" = "weekday",
             "Friday" = "weekday",
             "Saturday" = "weekend",
             "Sunday" = "weekend")
    )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

There are 6 variables which include `week`, `day_id`, `day`, `minute of
the day`, `activity_count`, and `weekday_or_weekend`. There are total
50,400 observations.
